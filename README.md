Simple Python script to rename a bunch of files from a serie

## How to use it :

You need to call the function renamesFiles which is located in the files.py file  
It takes 3 parameters:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;-The source directory  
&nbsp;&nbsp;-The destination directory (which can be the same as the source directory)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;-The parsing function that takes the current name of a file and return the new name of the file after parsing

Optionnaly, you can create an collection of arc that can that can be used in the parsing function
